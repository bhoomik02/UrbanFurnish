## Project Title
**UrbanFurnish – Modern Furniture Shopping Website**  
A clean, interactive, multi-page static website that replicates the feel of an online furniture store.

## What This Project Does

UrbanFurnish is a static, front-end-only website designed to mimic a real e-commerce furniture platform. It provides users with an elegant interface to explore various room setups, view furniture, add items to a shopping cart, and interact with a simple contact form, all using just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Website Flow & Features

- **Home Page (`index.html`)**
  Serves as the welcoming front for the brand. It introduces users to UrbanFurnish’s clean design and serves as the central navigation hub to other pages.

- **Rooms Page (`rooms.html`)**  
  Displays furniture options and room collections using cards. Each item features an "Add to Cart" button, which stores item data using localStorage. A live cart count is shown in the navigation bar to enhance user feedback.

- **Gallery Page (`gallery.html`)**  
  A visual showcase of lifestyle images which show the transformation of spaces using UrbanFurnish's high quality Furniture. Designed to inspire customers and build aesthetic trust by highlighting the ambiance created by UrbanFurnish pieces.

- **Contact Page (`contact.html`)**  
  Includes a simple HTML form that allows users to enter their name, email, phone number, and message, form submission redirects users to a Thank You page for a smooth interaction.

- **Cart Page (`cart.html`)**  
  Displays all the items a user has added to their cart. It allows them to review, remove, or clear their cart. The items persist across page reloads thanks to `localStorage`.

- **Thank You Page (`thankyou.html`)**  
  A basic confirmation message shown after a form is submitted and conveying that the customer will be contacted back soon. Simple and user-friendly.
